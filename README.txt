Alright so, how this works is it's sorta like a plug & play system

All you've gotta do is go find the bundle containing the model of the character you wish to replace, open it up in Asset Bundle Extractor (https://github.com/SeriousCache/UABE/releases/tag/v3.0-beta1), then replace the character's mesh object with the .json file of the unit you want from the convienently labeled "Dumps to Import" folder by selecting it, hitting import dump, and switching file type to .json
Note: I'm unsure if you can put the standard models on the winged characters, or if you can put winged characters over standard ones

Next you've just gotta select the Texture2D object, hit Plugins > Edit > Load, and then select the texture you wish to use, hit OK, then accept the slow quality setting, and wait a bit until the modified star appears next to the entry

Do these steps for each character you wish to replace

Then, you just save each bundle, and put them into your game's assets, and voila, you're well on your way to amassing your own army!
